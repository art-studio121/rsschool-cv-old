### Briefly About Myself:
I am 49 years old. As a designer, I started my career in 2002 by creating __Art Studio__ company. At first, the main activity of the company was the design and decoration of interiors. Then we moved on to creating design projects for private houses.

In parallel, starting as a teenager, I did not stop painting. Having joined the Creative Union of Artists of Russia in 2014, I began to take an active part in the exhibition activities of the union with my paintings. For which, in 2019, the leadership of the union was awarded a diploma *"For contribution to the domestic fine arts."

Since 2017, as a senior lecturer at the Samara State Technical University, I have been teaching such subjects as: _design; technical aesthetics; composition, painting and color science; drawing, sculpture; artistic graphics software systems; art history_.

Front-end development interested me as one of the most modern, actively developing types of activity, in which the knowledge and skills I already have can be in demand and widely applicable.
